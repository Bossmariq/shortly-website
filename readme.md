This is a website for shortening links, it has no functunality yet. But has been designed fully using tailwind

Navbar: Here we have the logo, menus and login/sign up links aligned with flex, and we also have the hamburger menu that shows up on medium screens and larger

Hero Section:Just an image and defining content styled using flex, that places them on a row on medium screens and column reverse on small screens

Shorten Section: This section has an input and other content below it, this is the part where you put your links so it can be shortened, i added javascript code to check for valid links, if a link is valid it displays an alert, if not it gives an error message

Stats Section: 

Feature Box: This section contains boxes that are placed on a row on big screens and then on columns on small screens, each box has an icon that is displayed as absolute and positioned, and content and a line behind it

CTA Section: call to action section

Footer: This has our logo, links and our social media icons
